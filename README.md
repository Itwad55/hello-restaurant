Applications that can easily be used to control income and expenditure of a restaurant based in an area with a low speed internet access.
Restaurants in Ethiopia with a low income such as Wolkite, control their food and drink products with a 'bono'. Each product item is assigned a 'bono'. A waiter buys this 'bono' with the price of the corresponding product item to sell the same item to a customer. Each day is started with an intitial working budget e.g 5000 birr. A waiter is given 1000 birr to start with, and he uses this budget to buy a 'bonos' everytime he has an order. He buys such item from the cashier, who gives him the 'bono' and accepts the corresponding price. Then the waiter takes payement from the customer of that item and keeps the money. At the end of the working hours, the manager counts the amount of 'bonos' collected by the waiter and the amount of money he has on his hands. The total sum of the bono prices and the total of the money must be equal. The restaurant will have expenidtures e.g buying bread, beers, oil etc. These items are paid for from the initial working budget of the day (5000 birr).
